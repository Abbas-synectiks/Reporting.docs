**Use Case Title: Transaction Type Cost** 

**Actor:** Financial Analyst (or anyone with access to the financial dashboard)

**Goal:** Gain insights into the composition of transaction costs by visualizing the breakdown of different transaction types (usage, tax, credit, recurring charges).

**Precondition:** The user has logged in to the platform and has access to the financial dashboard.

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. The user navigates to the financial dashboard within the platform.
1. On the dashboard, the user locates the "Transaction Type Cost" widget.
1. The widget displays a circle chart visually representing the breakdown of transaction costs by type.
   1. Each slice of the pie chart corresponds to a specific transaction type (usage, tax, credit, recurring charges).
   1. The size of each slice is proportional to the corresponding cost amount.
   1. Hovering over a slice displays a tooltip revealing the transaction type and its associated cost percentage or absolute value (depending on preference).
1. (Optional) The user can click on a specific slice of the pie chart to:
   1. Filter the dashboard or generate a report focusing on the selected transaction type.
   1. Drill down to a detailed view with a list of transactions belonging to that type.

**Alternative Flow:**

- If there are no transactions yet, the circle chart displays a message like "No Transaction Data Available."

**Exceptions:**

- The system encounters an error while retrieving transaction data. The user is presented with an error message and advised to contact support.

**Benefits:**

- Users can quickly understand the overall composition of their transaction costs at a glance.
- The circle chart provides a clear visual representation, making it easy to identify the most significant cost contributors.
- Optionally filtering by transaction type allows for deeper analysis of specific cost categories.


**Use Cases for "Available Budgets" Widget**

Following the example use case provided, here's a prompt to create use cases for the "Available Budgets" widget with budget cards:

**Actor:** Financial Analyst (or anyone with access to the financial dashboard)

**Goal:** Monitor and manage the organization's AWS budgets by viewing a consolidated overview and detailed information for each budget.

**Preconditions:**

- The user has logged in to the platform and has access to the financial dashboard.
- The user has appropriate permissions to view budget details.

**Use Case 1: Available Budgets Overview**

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. The user navigates to the financial dashboard within the platform.
1. The user locates the "Available Budgets" widget on the dashboard.
1. The widget displays a list of cards, each representing a single budget.
1. Each card displays the following information:
   1. Budget Name
   1. Department Name
   1. Time Period Left (e.g., "2 Months Remaining")
   1. Remaining Budget (absolute value)
   1. Budget Period (monthly, weekly, quarterly, yearly)
1. The card also features a progress bar:
   1. Divided from the center, visually separating remaining and spent budget.
   1. The right side of the bar displays the Total Budget Allocated.
   1. As spending increases, the filled portion of the bar on the left side expands towards the center, visually representing the remaining budget.
1. The user can quickly scan the list of cards to identify potential budget concerns based on:
   1. Low remaining budget values.
   1. Short time period left for expiration.

**Alternative Flow:**

- If there are no active budgets, the widget displays a message like "No Active Budgets Found."

**Benefits:**

- Provides a consolidated view of all active budgets within the organization.
- Users can easily assess the overall budget health based on remaining funds and expiration times.
- The progress bar offers a quick visual indicator of budget utilization.

**Use Case 2: Budget Card Details**

**Main Success Scenario (Building upon Use Case 1):**

1. The user clicks on a specific budget card in the "Available Budgets" widget.
1. Clicking the card displays a detailed view for that budget on a separate page.
1. The detailed view includes all information displayed on the card (budget name, department, time left, remaining budget, period) with potentially additional details like:
   1. Budget Description (optional)
   1. Planned vs. Actual Costs (optional)
   1. Cost Breakdown by Category (optional)
   1. Link to view historical cost data (optional)
1. (Optional) If overspending is detected (remaining budget is negative), the detailed view prominently displays a visual warning message like "Overspending."

**Benefits:**

- Provides deeper insights into individual budget details for informed decision-making.
- Allows users to analyze spending patterns and identify potential cost optimization opportunities.
- Alerts users to overspending situations requiring immediate attention.
