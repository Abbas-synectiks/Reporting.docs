 Appkube-Reporting Use Cases
 ---------------------------

 The Reporting Module acts as a central hub for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing cloud usage and expenditure. It empowers organizations to make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and drive cost savings across their cloud infrastructure. Through actionable insights and data-driven recommendations, the module enables organizations to maximize the value of their cloud investments while ensuring budget adherence and resource optimization.<br>
 <br>
  As Cloud admin we would like to see the following<br>
 - Dashboard Overview for all the clouds being utilized, and giving deep insights on spending overview and it's trend.<br>
   - Identifies the most utilized cloud services within the organization.<br>
   - Highlights potential cost-saving opportunities by optimizing resource usage.<br>
   - Displays the cost breakdown of top accounts to monitor spending patterns and Tracks spending trends over time to identify patterns. <br>
   <br>
- Chargeback Provides insights into cloud usage by different departments or teams.<br>
   - Facilitates the creation of detailed invoices based on resource usage, aiding in chargeback processes.<br>
   <br>
- Budget Dashboard alerts about accounts with high spending, enabling proactive budget management. Breaks down costs based on transaction types for better financial planning.<br>
  - Identifies top products contributing to high spending for optimization efforts.<br>
  - Flags departments or teams exceeding allocated budgets for corrective action.<br>
  <br>
- Cost Central lists the top five accounts with the highest spending for focused cost management.<br>
  -  Highlights the most utilized cloud services for resource optimization.<br>
  -  Identifies the top five regions with the highest resource consumption for strategic planning.<br>
  - Lists the top five products contributing to overall spending, guiding optimization strategies.
  <br>
- Cloud Central Dashboard shows total accounts, products, and services for a holistic view and classifies products as SOA or 3-tier architecture for optimization insights.<br>
    - Identifies cost-saving opportunities through right-sizing and resource optimization and categorizes resources as optimal, at risk, potential savings, or unanalyzed.
    - Highlights accounts with the highest number of associated products.
    - Identifies regions with the highest deployment of cloud services.
